## Event Details

Honors Undergraduate Research Day (HURD), December 8th at Lone Star College-University Park

**Research Summary**

This research examines water quality in the Spearford Gully, a tributary of Cypress Creek, before a significant drought in the summer of 2023. The study found that pre-drought conditions led to a decline in water quality, particularly in chlorophyll Î± and turbidity levels, which were sensitive to the onset of drought. These findings suggest that pre-drought surface water may require significant treatment to meet EPA guidelines and that earlier water usage restrictions could help manage the increased costs of such treatment.

## Quick Main Points

**Study Focus:**

Investigated water quality in Spearford Gully before a 2023 drought.

**Key Indicators:**

Chlorophyll Î± and turbidity were notably affected by pre-drought conditions.

**Implications:**

Pre-drought surface water may need extensive treatment to meet EPA guidelines.

**Recommendation:**

Earlier implementation of water and power usage restrictions to reduce treatment costs.

## Reflection

I am honored to be selected to present at the 2024 Great Plains Honors Council Conference at Oklahoma State University. I look forward to connecting with peers from across the region and learning from their impressive research. I am committed to preparing a presentation that not only meets but exceeds expectations, ensuring that the audience gains a clear and engaging understanding of my work.
