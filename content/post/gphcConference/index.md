**Quick Disclaimer**

A lot of the information here is going to be the same because I presented the same research at this conference as the previous conference. Nevertheless, enjoy!

## Event Details

Great Plains Honors Council (GPHC) 2024 Conference, March 23rd at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, OK

**Research Summary**

This research examines water quality in the Spearford Gully, a tributary of Cypress Creek, before a significant drought in the summer of 2023. The study found that pre-drought conditions led to a decline in water quality, particularly in chlorophyll α and turbidity levels, which were sensitive to the onset of drought. These findings suggest that pre-drought surface water may require significant treatment to meet EPA guidelines and that earlier water usage restrictions could help manage the increased costs of such treatment.

## Quick Main Points

**Study Focus**

Investigated water quality in Spearford Gully before a 2023 drought.

**Key Indicators**

Chlorophyll α and turbidity were notably affected by pre-drought conditions.

**Implications**

Pre-drought surface water may need extensive treatment to meet EPA guidelines.

**Recommendation**

Earlier implementation of water and power usage restrictions to reduce treatment costs.

**Reflection**

I'm grateful for the opportunity to present my research, not only to my institution but also to esteemed students from other institutions. I look forward to any future opportunities to share this work again.
