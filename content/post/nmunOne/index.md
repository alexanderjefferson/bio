## Event Details

National Model United Nations (NMUN) 2024 Conference, March 24th-29th in New York City, NY

**Background**

The NMUN team is composed entirely of honors students from across the Lone Star College system. Our delegation, representing both Survival International and the Philippines, included 30 students from various campuses. In preparation for the conference, we met weekly for four hours to strategize and research our organizations' standpoints. A highlight of our pre-conference preparation was the NMUN retreat in Galveston, where we bonded over games of Mafia and delivered preliminary speeches.

My partner Andy and I were assigned to the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), where we researched two key issues: the expanding risk landscape in Asia and the Pacific, and promoting a healthy, protected regional workforce. I couldnâ€™t have asked for a better partner as we excelled in our collaboration.

## The Conference

**Initial Difficulties**

Sixty percent of the schools attending this conference are international, which initially made communication challenging due to the diversity of cultures. However, our group successfully overcame this obstacle, and in the process, I developed valuable intercultural competency skills.

## Aftermath

**Honors**

Our team won the Outstanding Delegation Award for both our NGO, Survival International, and our country, the Philippines. This achievement reflects not only the dedication and hard work of our students but also the exceptional leadership of our mentors: Dr. Tiffee, Prof. Garcia, Prof. Lambert, and Dr. Howard.
