Create a personal knowledge base and share your knowledge with your peers.

Hugo Blox web framework empowers you with one of the most flexible note-taking capabilities out there.

Create a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.

Use it as your second brain, either publicly sharing your knowledge with your peers via your website, or via a private GitHub repository and password-protected site just for yourself.

**Research Summary**

This research examines water quality in the Spearford Gully, a tributary of Cypress Creek, before a significant drought in the summer of 2023. The study found that pre-drought conditions led to a decline in water quality, particularly in chlorophyll Î± and turbidity levels, which were sensitive to the onset of drought. These findings suggest that pre-drought surface water may require significant treatment to meet EPA guidelines and that earlier water usage restrictions could help manage the increased costs of such treatment.

## Quick Main Points

**Study Focus**

Investigated water quality in Spearford Gully before a 2023 drought.

**Key Indicators**

Chlorophyll Î± and turbidity were notably affected by pre-drought conditions.

**Implications**

Pre-drought surface water may need extensive treatment to meet EPA guidelines.

**Recommendation**

Earlier implementation of water and power usage restrictions to reduce treatment costs.

**Moving Forward**

I am honored to be selected to present at the 2024 Great Plains Honors Council Conference at Oklahoma State University. I look forward to connecting with peers from across the region and learning from their impressive research. I am committed to preparing a presentation that not only meets but exceeds expectations, ensuring that the audience gains a clear and engaging understanding of my work.
